# LiDAR-ML-Research

## OBJECTIVE

Conducting machine learning research focused on classifying and reconstructing 3D object data from partial LiDAR images. By generating classifying and completing figures from partial point clouds, our research focuses on creating detailed visualizations that improve applications such as autonomous vehicles and robotics. This is onging work started in September 2024, and the full repository will be uploaded once we are finished with the paper.
