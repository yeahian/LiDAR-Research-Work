# LiDAR-ML-Research

## OBJECTIVE

Conducting machine learning research focused on reconstructing 3D object data from partial LiDAR images. By generating classifying and completing figures from partial point clouds, our research focuses on creating detailed visualizations that improve applications such as autonomous vehicles and robotics. This is onoging work and I will be updating this repository as we run tests on the various PointNet versions.
